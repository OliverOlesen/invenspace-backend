# invenspace-backend

This is a project I worked on with a friend to get to know symfony.<br>
Was shown the basics of what I should/could do, and have then created this.

The main focus of this project was getting some hand on experience,<br>
with a bigger framework, and also how it sort of works in an actual usable environment.

Of course there are things which could have been done better, however, I am not aware of those yet<br>
Only one way of learning, which is by doing. So this is my attempt.

Wouldn't mind feedback on things which could be done differently/smarter.
